# How to Update Your Project on GitHub

Follow these simple steps to save your latest code changes to your GitHub repository. It's a good practice to do this after we've added new features or fixed things.

---

### Step 1: Open Your Terminal

First, you need to open a command-line terminal or console in your project's main folder. If you are using a code editor like VS Code, it usually has a built-in terminal.

---

### Step 2: Add Your Changes

This command prepares all the new and modified files to be saved.

```bash
git add .
```
*(Don't forget the dot `.` at the end!)*

---

### Step 3: Save (Commit) Your Changes

This command saves your changes with a descriptive message. You can change the message to describe what we did (e.g., "Added file deletion feature").

```bash
git commit -m "Updated project with new features"
```

---

### Step 4: Push Your Changes to GitHub

This command sends your saved changes up to your GitHub repository, making them available online.

```bash
git push
```

You're all done! Your GitHub repository is now up-to-date with all the latest changes. Let me know if you have any questions!
