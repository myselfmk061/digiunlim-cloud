## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #29ABE2 (RGB hex) for a modern, tech-focused feel reminiscent of cloud services. It's vibrant and contrasts well with a light background.
- Background color: #F0F8FF (RGB hex), a very light tint of the primary blue. This maintains a visual relationship with the primary color while providing a clean backdrop.
- Accent color: #635985 (RGB hex), an analogous color to the primary but a different hue, for contrast on interactive elements. The dimmer brightness allows it to recede visually, keeping the brighter blue prominent.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headlines and body text. Its neutral and modern look provides a clean, readable interface suitable for a cloud storage application.
- Use simple, outline-style icons to represent file types and actions.
- Design a clean, intuitive layout with clear hierarchy to ensure ease of use.
- Incorporate subtle animations to provide feedback during file upload and other actions.
